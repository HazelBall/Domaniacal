				<h2>General FAQ</h2>
				<a class = "accordion-header" data-tether = "faq1">How many players can play Domaniacal?</a>
				<div class = "accordion primary" id = "faq1">
					<p>A normal game of Domaniacal can confortably play 2-5 players. However, mixing together two decks can double it to 10 players!</p>
				</div>
				<a class = "accordion-header" data-tether = "faq2">What is the minimum age to play Domaniacal?</a>
				<div class = "accordion primary" id = "faq2">
					<p>We reccomend players be 8 years old or older, to make sure they understand the concepts and mechanics of the game.</p>
				</div>
				<a class = "accordion-header" data-tether = "faq3">How long does each game usually last?</a>
				<div class = "accordion primary" id = "faq3">
					<p>Each game usually lasts between 5 and 10 minutes, although shorter and longer games can happen.</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "spacer small"></div>
				<h2>Gameplay FAQ</h2>
				<a class = "accordion-header" data-tether = "faq4">Can I steal more than 1 card at a time?</a>
				<div class = "accordion primary" id = "faq4">
					<p>You can only steal 1 card at a time, before following up with one of your own cards. However, you can steal and play as many times as you would like within your turn.</p>
				</div>
				<a class = "accordion-header" data-tether = "faq5">What happens when there is a tie?</a>
				<div class = "accordion primary" id = "faq5">
					<p>If there is a tie at the end of the game, players can choose their own way of settling it, or leave it as a tie. Although we recommend a battle to the death, "rock, paper, scissors" or "youngest wins" also works.</p>
				</div>
				<a class = "accordion-header" data-tether = "faq6">Do I have to play during my turn?</a>
				<div class = "accordion primary" id = "faq6">
					<p>In most cases, <strong>no</strong>. You do not have to play a card during your turn if you do not want to. As long as you have drawn a card, you can announce the end of your turn at any point. This can be especially useful if you can only play a double card, or if you don't want a card stolen by someone else.</p>
					<p><strong>However</strong>, if the draw pile is empty, <em>you must play any cards you can</em> in order to keep the game moving. Trust us, your opponents will thank you.</p>
				</div>
				<a class = "accordion-header" data-tether = "faq7">What do I do when I've run out of cards to play?</a>
				<div class = "accordion primary" id = "faq7">
					<p>If you run out of cards to play during your turn, your turn is officially over. If you have no more cards in your hand, just wait until your next turn and draw like normal.</p>
