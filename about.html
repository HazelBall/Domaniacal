					Domaniacal was first conceived in July of 2019. 
					The original idea for the game was, quite literally, "Go Fish... but with Dominoes".
					You may think that sounds like a terrible idea, and so did everyone else. But it was an idea.
					Over the course of half a year, with the help of many others, I revised, changed, and fixed the game to become the fun card game it is today.
				</p>
				<p>
					Domaniacal isn't being sold anymore but that doesn't mean it isn't an amazingly fun game that I had a blast creating and sharing with the world.
					Raising over $2500, selling over 200 decks, and selling over 50 more in just a few years is no small feat, and Domaniacal tackled it with grace.
				</p>
				<p>
					Special thanks to Noah Roppe, Laine Slinglend, Ewan Gregory, and many others who helped with the logos, assets, and game mechanics,
					and who constantly dealt with awful ideas, poor concepts, and hours of constant playtesting in order to make the game what it is.
					This game has, in many ways, taken over our lives at times, and I could not thank you enough for your support.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most importantly, Iâ€™d like to thank you all for supporting Domaniacal through this journey.
					My goal in life is to create things that help or entertain people in new and unique ways, and Domaniacal was a passion project of mine that I was so luckily able to make a reality.
					I hope you enjoy it and the many other projects I have been waiting to creat, and I appreciate your continued support to me and my efforts!
				</p>
				<p>With love,</p>
