				<p>Domaniacal was first conceived in July of 2019. The original idea for the game was, quite literally, "Go Fish with Dominoes". You may think that is a terrible idea, and it was, but it was an idea nonetheless. Over the course of half a year, we have revised, changed, and fixed the game to become the cutthroat card game it is today.</p>
				<p>Special thanks to Noah Roppe, Laine Slinglend, Ewan Gregory, and many others who constantly dealt with awful ideas, poor concepts, and hours of constant playtesting in order to make the game what it is. This game has, in many ways, taken over our lives at times, and we could not thank you enough for your efforts.</p>
				<p>Most importantly, weâ€™d like to thank you all for supporting Domaniacal through this journey. Our goal is to create fun games that entertain people in new and unique ways, and Domaniacal is the test pilot for us. We hope you enjoy it and the many other games we have awaiting to be created, and continue to support us and our efforts!</p>
